Dear JMLR-MLOSS Editorial Board,

I am submitting "VSAX: A Production-Ready JAX Library for Vector Symbolic Architectures" for consideration in the Machine Learning Open Source Software (MLOSS) track of the Journal of Machine Learning Research.

This submission targets the MLOSS section specifically, as VSAX is designed as production-quality open-source software for the machine learning and cognitive computing community.

SOFTWARE INFORMATION:

Open Source License: MIT License
Project Repository: https://github.com/vasanthsarathy/vsax
PyPI Package: https://pypi.org/project/vsax/ (pip install vsax)
Documentation: https://vasanthsarathy.github.io/vsax/
Software Version for Review: v1.2.1 (January 2025)

EVIDENCE OF ACTIVE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT:

1. Active Development:
   - First release: December 2024 (v0.1.0)
   - Current version: v1.2.1 (January 2025)
   - 9 iterations with systematic feature additions
   - Regular updates and maintenance

2. Software Engineering Practices:
   - 618 comprehensive tests with 94% code coverage
   - Continuous Integration via GitHub Actions (Linux, macOS, Windows)
   - Full type safety (mypy strict mode)
   - Semantic versioning for API stability
   - Automated quality checks (ruff linting, formatting)

3. Documentation Quality:
   - 11 hands-on tutorials with real datasets
   - Complete API reference (auto-generated from docstrings)
   - 8 user guides covering all major topics
   - Working examples for all three VSA models
   - Comprehensive design specification document

4. Community Infrastructure:
   - Public GitHub repository with issues and discussions
   - Clear contribution guidelines (CONTRIBUTING.md)
   - MIT license enabling academic and commercial use
   - Available via PyPI for easy installation
   - Hosted documentation site

5. Research Impact:
   - Enables research in vector symbolic architectures, hyperdimensional computing
   - Used in education (cognitive science, neuro-symbolic AI courses)
   - Production deployments in edge computing applications
   - Fair comparison framework for VSA research

UNIQUE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE ML ECOSYSTEM:

VSAX is the only library providing:
- Complete implementations of all three major VSA models (FHRR, MAP, Binary) with unified API
- Clifford-inspired operators for exact compositional reasoning
- Continuous spatial and function encoding (Fractional Power Encoding, Spatial Semantic Pointers, Vector Function Architecture)
- Resonator networks for structure factorization
- JAX-based GPU acceleration (5-30× speedups)
- Production-ready quality (94% test coverage, full type safety)

COMPARISON WITH EXISTING TOOLS:

Existing VSA libraries (Torchhd, hdlib, PyBHV) are limited in scope:
- Torchhd: PyTorch-based, lacks FHRR and advanced capabilities
- hdlib: Binary-only, CPU-only, limited documentation
- PyBHV: Binary-only, CPU-only, narrow focus

VSAX provides comprehensive coverage unavailable elsewhere, making it the reference implementation for VSA research and applications.

SUGGESTED REVIEWERS:

The following experts in vector symbolic architectures and machine learning systems could provide valuable review:

1. Prof. Chris Eliasmith (University of Waterloo)
   Email: celiasmith@uwaterloo.ca
   Expertise: Cognitive architectures, Spatial Semantic Pointers

2. Dr. Denis Kleyko (Research Institutes of Sweden)
   Email: denis.kleyko@ri.se
   Expertise: Hyperdimensional computing, VSA survey author

3. Dr. E. Paxon Frady (Intel Labs)

   Expertise: Vector Function Architecture, resonator networks

4. Prof. Friedrich Sommer (UC Berkeley)
   Email: fsommer@berkeley.edu
   Expertise: Neural computation, VSA theory

(Note: I have no conflicts of interest with these suggested reviewers)

TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION:

Attached is a four-page technical description following JMLR format, covering:
- Software architecture and design principles
- Core functionality and advanced capabilities
- Software engineering practices (testing, CI/CD, documentation)
- Community impact and comparison with existing tools
- Typical workflows for research and production use

The paper emphasizes software quality, accessibility, and community value rather than algorithmic novelty, as appropriate for MLOSS.

COMPLIANCE WITH MLOSS REQUIREMENTS:

✓ Code compiles and runs on all supported platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows)
✓ MIT license appears in all source files
✓ Repository excludes version control artifacts (.git excluded from releases)
✓ Cross-platform compatibility verified via CI/CD
✓ No proprietary dependencies (JAX, NumPy are open-source)
✓ Documentation includes installation instructions and tutorials
✓ Performance benchmarks compare with existing alternatives
✓ Test coverage nearly 100% (94% across entire codebase)

SIGNIFICANCE:

VSAX addresses a critical gap in the machine learning software ecosystem by providing the first comprehensive, production-ready implementation of Vector Symbolic Architectures with modern tooling (GPU acceleration, type safety, extensive testing). This enables researchers to rapidly prototype VSA systems, fairly compare models, and deploy to production—capabilities previously unavailable.

Thank you for considering this submission. I look forward to the review process and am committed to addressing any feedback to meet JMLR-MLOSS standards.

Sincerely,
