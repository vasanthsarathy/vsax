# Module 1: Foundations of Vector Symbolic Architectures

Welcome to Module 1! This module introduces the foundational concepts of VSA/HDC.

## Module Overview

**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand why high-dimensional vectors enable symbolic computation
- Master the two fundamental operations: binding and bundling
- Learn the three VSA models in VSAX (FHRR, MAP, Binary)
- Write your first VSAX program

**Duration:** ~3-4 hours

**Prerequisites:** Basic Python, NumPy knowledge
