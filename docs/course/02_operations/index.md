# Module 2: Core Operations and Models

Welcome to Module 2! This module provides deep dives into the three VSA models and their operations.

## Module Overview

**Learning Objectives:**
- Master FHRR operations (circular convolution, FFT, phase mathematics)
- Master MAP and Binary operations
- Understand similarity metrics and search
- Develop decision framework for model selection

**Duration:** ~4-5 hours

**Prerequisites:** Module 1 (Foundations)

## Lessons

1. [Deep Dive - FHRR Operations](01_fhrr.md)
2. [Deep Dive - MAP and Binary Operations](02_map_binary.md)
3. [Similarity Metrics and Search](03_similarity.md)
4. [Model Selection Decision Framework](04_selection.md)

## Module Capstone

Compare all three VSA models on a custom dataset and benchmark their performance.
